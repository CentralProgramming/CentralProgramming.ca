                        <h2>About the CPC</h2>
                        <p>New in 2017, Central's Programming Club was founded by four students in the wake of the ECOO group programming contest. After moving on to the second round (but not further), they noted the distinct lack of practice that lead to their defeat. In an attempt to remedy this, Central Programming Club was born.</p>

                        <p>With a focus on more than just coding problems, the CPC hopes to bring together people with a passion for problem solving or code. Our goal is to go beyond what we learn in class to create something meaningful, whether that means preparing for a contest, applying skills to make an app or game, or simply learning more about programming.</p>

                        <p>No prior coding experience is required to join! We can point you towards resources to help you learn, and we're always available to answer any questions you may have. We strive to provide resources&mdash;including homework help&mdash;in order to assist everyone in reaching their goals.</p>

                        <h2>Why Learn to Code?</h2>
                        <p>Programming gives you the ability to translate your ideas into reality and create something you can be proud of. Whether you want to design the next big app or game, make a useful piece of software, create a stunning website, or change the world, the power of programming allows you to accomplish your dreams. The possibilities are endless.</p>

                        <p>Anyone can learn code. You donâ€™t need to be a math genius or a science whiz. Creative thinking and problem solving skills are the key to coding success. Programming exercises and strengthens these skills (along with critical and alternative thinking) which can then be applied in a multitude of disciples. Not interested in pursuing computer science? Learning to code can still help you gain transferable skills that are useful no matter what your future may hold. Plus, it's a lot of fun, too! <p/>

                        <p>Programming isn't difficult to learn; with a little time and patience, anyone can code, and make something worthwhile.</p>
