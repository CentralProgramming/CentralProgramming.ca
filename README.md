# CentralProgramming.github.io
This is the static version of a site previously made with html. It served as the Central Programming Club's webiste for the 2017-2018 school year. Once the domain/web hosting was expired, it was made static in order to be hosted on GitHub and viewed for future reference. As such, certain features such as forms and emails are no longer available. We'd like to thank everyone for making Central Programming Club an enjoyable experience for all those involved.
